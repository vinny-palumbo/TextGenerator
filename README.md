# Text Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks

In this project, I've implemented a Recurrent Neural Network with an LSTM architecture that generates sentences based on "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle, by building them up character-by-character.

## Environment

Here is my [environment file](https://github.com/vinny-palumbo/TextGenerator/blob/master/environment.yaml). To clone my environment execute: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
